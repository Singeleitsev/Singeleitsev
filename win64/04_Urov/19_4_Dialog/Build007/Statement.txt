1. The ASM Code is written correctly.
The goal was to understand in/out operations with a Dialog Window.
This goal has been achieved.

2. But there's a severe error in *.rc file/
Urov's original code places LTEXT's after EDITTEXT's
This sequence causes an error with duplicating, shifting,
and overlapping of all elements.

3. Placing LTEXT's before EDITTEXT's fixes an error with *duplicating*
But the new error occurs.
After filling all fields and pressing "OK" button
the Application stops responding
and continues to operate only after switching to any other application
and re-setting focus from the TaskBar

4. I won't search the reason of this error now because:
(a) it doesn't affect the functions
that were studied in the Urov's Lesson 19.
(b) it's caused by the original Urov's code
that was made for TASM32
